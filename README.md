# Kitsu's Anime

An anime app that helps to manage what have you already seen and what you have yet to see. 

## Feel to download and use

Made this project to first help me manage the content that I need help managing, like what episode I last saw of One Piece, and second to try out [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/)
All animes, and episode information are from [HorribleSubs](https://horriblesubs.info/), they are, in my opinion, very good at subbing and if you can, help them out.

The released app is on the root of this repository.
